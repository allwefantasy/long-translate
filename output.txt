To address the issue of the file selection and target language div overflowing its parent container, we need to make some adjustments to the CSS in the index.scss file. Here are the changes we can make:

```python
##File: /Users/allwefantasy/WeChatProjects/long-translate/miniprogram/pages/index/index.scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border-radius: 16px;
  padding: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

.file-and-language {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 16px;
}
=======
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border-radius: 16px;
  padding: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
}

.file-and-language {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 16px;
}

.file-section,
.language-section {
  width: 100%;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:

1. Add `box-sizing: border-box;` to the `.card` class to ensure padding is included in the element's total width.
2. Add `width: 100%;` to the `.card` class to make sure it takes up the full width of its container.
3. Add new rules for `.file-section` and `.language-section` to ensure they also take up the full width of their parent.

These modifications should prevent the content from overflowing the parent div. The file selection and target language sections will now be properly contained within the card, and the card itself will fit within its parent container.

Would you like me to explain or break down this code change?
