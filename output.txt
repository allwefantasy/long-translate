To address the invalid permissions in the app.json file, we need to remove the incorrect permission entries. Let's modify the app.json file to remove these invalid permissions. Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* to make this change:

```json
##File: /Users/allwefantasy/WeChatProjects/long-translate/miniprogram/app.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  "lazyCodeLoading": "requiredComponents",
  "permission": {
    "scope.writePhotosAlbum": {
      "desc": "保存翻译结果到相册"
    },
    "scope.userStorage": {
      "desc": "保存翻译结果到文件"
    }
  }
=======
  "lazyCodeLoading": "requiredComponents"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the invalid "permission" section from the app.json file. The WeChat Mini Program doesn't use these specific permission scopes in the way they were defined. Instead, the necessary permissions for file system access are typically handled automatically by the WeChat runtime environment.

For saving files, the Mini Program can use the wx.getFileSystemManager() API without needing explicit permissions in the app.json file. The ability to save files within the Mini Program's sandbox is generally allowed by default.

If you need to save files to the user's device or access the photo album, you should use the appropriate API calls (like wx.saveImageToPhotosAlbum() for saving images to the photo album), which will prompt the user for permission when necessary, without needing to declare these permissions in app.json.

Would you like me to explain or clarify anything about this change?
